## Quick overview

Fruktorama is a Tetrislike game where the player
tries to match at least three of a kind either diagonally
or orthogonally.

Fruits are dropped from the above and can be rotated to make matches easier.
Each time a block of fruits moves down the player gets one point.

Each diagonally or orthogonally row of at least three fruits of the same kind
will be removed. Points are scored as ten times the number of fruits removed.
